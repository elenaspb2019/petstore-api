# Overview

## About the company

Paws & Tails has been providing a digital marketplace and IT consultancy for thousands of pet shops all around the globe since 2013.
We help our customers with pet shop management using both CMS and REST API as well as with building their websites and mobile apps.

## Paws & Tails API

Paws & Tails provides a REST API - a digital interface for your pet shop data. It allows managing all data related to pets, orders and so on and integrating existing products like mobile apps.

Using this REST API, pet shop staff or client applications can exchange data with the Paws & Tails server.

Data is transferred in text format via the Internet using HTTP requests of different types.

All data is transferred safely using state-of-the-art encryption.

To work with the Paws & Tails API, you need to get an API key.

We recommend reading [Paws & Tails API tutorial](userguide.md) before working with the API reference.
